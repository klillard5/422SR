Dev. log: Lindy Myers

Week of May 1:

	Work on creating the project proposal and defining goals for the project.

Week of May 8:

	Downloading files necessary to create and run android apps. Planned what the
	android app will look like, what features it will offer compared to the web-app.
	(Android app won't include dispatch login.)


Week of May 15:

	Looked through online tutorials for help with android apps. Creating a test app 
	to understand android programming. Work with creating text fields, buttons and 
	entry fields and other aspects of the android app.
	
	Creating actual android app. Created a basic login page and ride request page
	with all expected fields. This offers no login/password verification. Allows users 
	to go straight to request ride page upon pressing login button.
	
Week of May 22:

	Work on connecting android app to server. Looked into many tutorials, guides
	and other sources. Spent more than ten hours trying to figure out how to connect
	the application to the node server unsuccessfully. Connecting the two will be 
	first goal of the next iteration/sprint. (Which will not occur since this class
	ends.)
	
	Created Saferide request success page that pops up once submit button is pressed.
	Additionally, learned how to include images into android apps and adjust default
	padding around the images. With that, included banner on different pages of the
	application. Also learned how to remove default banner from the application to
	use actual Saferide banner instead. Created all connections between different 
	pages of the application so that users can freely manuever around the app. Created
	mock login verification that would check to see if login/password matched certain
	values, but commented it out as the application is not currently connected to
	server. Other additional stylizing.
